# FCB

I had this idea long ago. It is not new, and it is not innovative. It
is a binary file format to store other files, an archive. It uses a
FCB (File Control Block) to keep control of what was archived.

It is as simple as it looks like. It has several interesting patterns
in C which demonstrates some interesting aspects of the language.
